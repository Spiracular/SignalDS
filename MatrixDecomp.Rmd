# Working up to Singular Value Decomposition

**Complex Conjugate:** Expressed as $\overline{A}$. Normal coordinates: $ax+bi \rightarrow ax+(-b)i$. In polar coordinates: $\rho e^{i\phi} \rightarrow \rho e^{-i\phi}$

**[Transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose):** Oft expressed as $A^T$  or $A^*$. Wiki also comes with succinct descriptions of Special Transpose Matrices.

**Conjugate Transpose: **
$\overline{A^T}$

$$A^\dagger$$

### **Unitary Matrix:**
$U^\dagger U = U U^\dagger = I$

### **Heritian Matrix:** 
- Complex Square Matrix
- Equals own Conjugate Transpose 

$$A = A^\dagger$$
$$a_{ij} = \overline{a_{ji}}$$

## **Positive Semidefinite Hermitian Matrix:**
for all $x \in C^n$ : $x^\dagger A x \geq 0$

#### **[Matrix Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition):** Factorization of Matrices as a Product of Matrices 

### Eigendecomposition (aka Spectral Decomposition)

aka factorization into canonical form

$A = VDV^{-1}$

- $A$: square matrix
- $V$: cols are eigenvectors
- $D$: diagonal formed from eigenvectors

#### Eigenvectors

Eigenvector of some transformation $T(v)$ is a (non-zero) vector $v$ that does not change direction under that linear transformation.

$$T(v) = \lambda v$$

The **eigenvalue** is the scalar $lambda$.

The linear transformation [in the case of matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix), is...

$$Av = \lambda v$$

alternatively phrased as

$$(A-\lambda I)v = 0$$

**Kernel: ** (Linear Algebra) for linear mapping $L$ that maps between vectorspaces $V$ and $W$,  $L : V -> W$, the kernel (aka nullspace) is the set of all elements v in V for which $L(v) = 0$ where 0 is the zero-vecotr in W. In set-builder notation...

$$ker(L) = \{ v \in V | L(v) = 0 \}$$


## Matrix Polar Decomposition
$A = UP$

- $A$ is a square matrix
- $U$ is a Unitary Matrix
- $P$ is a Positive Semidefinite Hermitian Matrix

# Singular Value Decomposition

Uses Polar Decomposition to generalize Eigendecomposition to any $mxn$ matrix
$$SVD( M) = UDV = U \Sigma V^*$$

UDV is notation in R; the other is as written on Wikipedia

- $U$: Unitary matrix (known as Left Singular Value)
- $\Sigma$: Diagonal
- $V^*$: Unitary matrix (known as Right Singular Value)
- Both Singular Values: $\sqrt{eigenvalue \ \lambda}$ of $M^*M$ and $MM^*$
